  <h3>Background Introduction</h3>
</div>
With scenic views, mild climate, and friendly people, Vancouver is well-known around the world as both a popular tourist attraction and one of the best places to live. Its diverse natual environment,such as mountains, oceans and diverse wild animal, has attarcted a lot of immigrants to live here. One of the most important features, vancouver trees, also contributes a lot to the amazing beauty of Vancouver city. I am curious about how trees are distributed in different vancouver neighbourhood, what kind of genus they are and when they were planted.

  <h3>Work Done</h3>

To answer these questions, I have completed the following analysis:

:white_check_mark: Carried out exploratory data analysis using vancouver tree dataset [Data used in this project is a subset of Vancouver Street Trees dataset](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/street-trees/information/?disjunctive.species_name&disjunctive.common_name&disjunctive.height_range_id&disjunctive.on_street&disjunctive.neighbourhood_name)


( :heart: to see the full report, please download the jupyter notebook or html file )
<br>
<br>
:white_check_mark: Used different barcharts, scatterplots and so on to visualize data

:white_check_mark: Finally, I created an interactive dashboard to present the tree details of specific/selected vancouver neighbourhood, through which people can visualize the summarized data by selecting different neigborhood and tree Genus.
