## Vancouver_Tree_Dataset_Analysis_and_Visualization

My nationality is China. I came to Canada to study several years ago and what impressed me the most is its beautiful natural environment. With its scenic views, mild climate, and friendly people, Vancouver is well-known around the world as both a popular tourist attraction and one of the best places to live. Its diverse natual environment,such as mountains, oceans and diverse wild animal, has attarcted a lot of immigrants to live here. One of the most important features, vancouver trees, also contributes a lot to the amazing beauty of Vancouver city. I am curious about how trees are distributed in different vancouver neighbourhood, what kind of genus they are, when they were planted, and so on. 

To answer these questions, I have carried out a exploratory data analysis and visualization on the vancouver tree dataset. In the end, I created an interactive dashboard to present the tree details of specific/selected vancouver neighbourhood. The data used in this project is a subset of Vancouver Street Trees dataset (https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/street-trees/information/?disjunctive.species_name&disjunctive.common_name&disjunctive.height_range_id&disjunctive.on_street&disjunctive.neighbourhood_name). The data were obtained from The city of Vancouver's Open Data Portal and follows an Open Government Licence â€“ Vancouver (https://opendata.vancouver.ca/pages/licence/).
